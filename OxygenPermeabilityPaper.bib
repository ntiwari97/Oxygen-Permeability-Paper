	abstract = {The wettability of the Pt/carbon/Nafion catalyst layer in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is critical to their performance and durability, especially the cathode, as water is needed for the transport of protons to the active sites and is also involved in deleterious Pt nanoparticle dissolution and carbon corrosion. Therefore, the focus of this work has been on the first-time use of the water droplet impacting method to determine the wettability of 100\% Nafion films, as a benchmark, and then of Vulcan carbon (VC)/Nafion composite films, both deposited by spin-coating in the Pt-free state. Pure Nafion films, shown by SEM analysis to have a nanochanneled structure, are initially hydrophobic but become hydrophilic as the water droplet spreads, likely due to reorientation of the sulfonic acid groups toward water. The wettability of VC/Nafion composite films depends significantly on the VC/Nafion mass ratios, even though Nafion is believed to be preferentially oriented (sulfonate groups toward VC) in all cases. At low VC contents, a significant water droplet contact angle hysteresis is seen, similar to pure Nafion films, while at higher VC contents ({\textgreater}30\%), the films become hydrophobic, also exhibiting superhydrophobicity, with surface roughness playing a significant role. At {\textgreater}80\% VC, the surfaces become wettable again as there is insufficient Nafion loading present to fully cover the carbon surface, allowing the calculation of the Nafion:carbon ratio required for a full coverage of carbon by Nafion.},

	abstract = {The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at platinum electrodes covered with perfluorosulfonated ionomer film was studied in 0.05 mol dm-3 H2SO4 in the presence of various kinds of ammonium ions. Ammonium ion derivatives (R4N)2SO4 (R = H, CH3) and (R4N)HSO4 (R = C2H5, C3H7, and C4H9) were added with various amounts in the solution. The electrochemical measurements of ORR were performed to evaluate both charge transfer and diffusion kinetics of oxygen reduction at the Nafion film covered platinum rotating disk electrode. ORR was affected differently for different molecular weights of ammonium derivative ions. The suppression of ORR started in a short time for ammonium derivative ions of high molecular weight, reflecting the strong adsorption at the platinum surface. It was inferred that these ions strongly distorted the electric field at the platinum{\textbar}ionomer interface. From the knowledge, a new method to inhibit the ORR degradation at platinum{\textbar}ionomer interface was proposed, and several kinds of carboxylic acids or amino acids were tested as additives in the ionomer film. It was discovered that these additives successfully inhibit the ORR degradation brought about by impurity cations. After investigating the ORR kinetics, it was found that the additives prevented the degradation of the charge transfer step effectively, but the diffusion process in the film was degraded more by these additives.},

	abstract = {Significant reductions in expensive platinum catalyst loading for the oxygen reduction reaction are needed for commercially viable fuel cell electric vehicles as well as other important applications. In reducing loading, a resistance at the Pt surface in the presence of thin perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) electrolyte film, on the order of 10 nm thick, becomes a significant barrier to adequate performance. However, the resistance mechanism is unresolved and could be due to gas dissolution kinetics, increased diffusion resistance in thin films, or electrolyte anion interactions. A common hypothesis for the origin of the resistance is a highly reduced oxygen permeability in the thin polymer electrolyte films that coat the catalyst relative to bulk permeability that is caused by nanoscale confinement effects. Unfortunately, the prior work has not separated the thin-film gas transport resistance from that associated with PFSA interactions with a polarized catalyst surface. Here, we present the first characterization of the thin-film O2 transport resistance in the absence of a polarized catalyst, using a nanoporous substrate that geometrically mimics the active catalyst particles. Through a parametric study of varying PFSA film thickness, as thin as 50 nm, we observe no enhanced gas transport resistance in thin films as a result of either interfacial effects or structural changes in the PFSA. Our results suggest that other effects, such as anion poisoning at the Pt catalyst, could be the source of the additional resistance observed at low Pt loading.},

In the first part of this study, novel modifications of the electrochemical monitoring technique to precisely measure the hydrogen and oxygen permeabilities of Nafion are presented. With these techniques, the gas permeabilities of Nafion were observed to be independent of pressures, which was ascribed to a solely diffusive process. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the hydrogen and oxygen permeabilities through Nafion in the fully hydrated state (where the water content is independent of the temperature) were measured in order to determine the activation energies of the permeation mechanisms. On the basis of the measured influence of temperature and relative humidity on the gas permeabilities of Nafion, the pathways for gas permeation through its aqueous and solid phase are qualitatively discussed. The second part of this study presents a resistor network model to quantitatively correlate the microscopic structure of Nafion and its gas permeabilities.},

Whereas it is known that water uptake, water transport, and proton conductivity are reduced upon reducing relative humidity, the effect on oxygen mass transport remains unknown. We report a two-electrode approach to determine mass transport coefficients for the oxygen reduction reaction in air at the Pt/perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer membrane interface between 90 and 30\% RH at 70 °C using a Pt microdisk in a solid state electrochemical cell. Potential-step chronoamperometry was performed at specific mass-transport limiting potentials to allow for the elucidation of the oxygen diffusion coefficient (D(bO2)) and oxygen concentration (c(bO2)). In our efforts, novel approaches in data acquisition, as well as analysis, were examined because of the dynamic nature of the membrane under lowered hydration conditions. Linear regression analysis reveals a decrease in oxygen permeability (D(bO2c(bO2)) by a factor of 1.7 and 3.4 from 90 to 30\% RH for Nafion 211 membrane and membranes cast from Nafion DE2020 ionomer solutions, respectively. Additionally, nonlinear curve fitting by way of the Shoup-Szabo equation is employed to analyze the entire current transient during potential step controlled ORR. We also report on the presence of an RH dependence of our previously reported time-dependency measurements for O2 mass transport coefficients.},

It was found that R-other was increased with the decrease of Pt-loadings of the CLs although their thickness was decreased. Effective Knudsen diffusion coefficient was calculated from the pore size distribution and the porosity. It was estimated almost steady regardless of the Pt-loadings. To understand the increase of R-other, a simple transport model was established including Knudsen diffusion resistance in secondary pores and the local transport resistance around the Pt surface. Knudsen diffusion resistance should be decreased in lower Pt-loadings because of the shorter transport length. On the other hand, it was considered that the local transport resistance was increased with decreasing of the effective Pt surface area. Hence, that the effective Pt surface area might be one of the important factors for R-other in the CLs, especially in the lower Pt-loadings.},

	abstract = {During proton-exchange-membrane-fuel-cell degradation various changes occur in the membrane-electrode assembly, and consequently the performance decays. Therefore, the correlation between physical property changes and the performance decay is important. In this paper, we focus on this correlation and have developed a quantitative model to estimate the performance decay after degradation. Comparison of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and polarization curves before and after potential cycling demonstrates that there was more performance decay than that estimated due only to ECSA decrease, especially at higher current densities. This large performance decay is estimated and quantitatively simulated to be due to the increase in oxygen transport resistance caused by the oxygen transport through the ionomer film coating the Pt/C particles in the cathode catalyst layer. It is shown that the data can be fit by assuming that the effective ionomer film area is proportional to ECSA. According to our results, the transport resistance increased significantly during potential cycling and more than half of the performance decay at high current densities originated from the increased transport overpotential. The effect of proton overpotential in the cathode catalyst layer was also studied with additional performance decay witnessed under low-humidity conditions.},

The new membranes under development have the trade name Hyflon Ion. After briefly reviewing the literature on the Dow ionomer, new characterization data are reported on extruded Hyflon Ion membranes. The data are compared to those available in the literature on the Dow SSC ionomer and membranes. Comparison is made also with data obtained in this work or available in the literature on the long-side-chain (LSC) perfluorinated ionomer (Nafion). Thermal, visco-elastic, water absorption and mechanical properties of Hyflon Ion are studied. While the general behavior is similar to that shown in the past by the Dow membranes, slight differences are evident in the hydration behavior at equivalent weight (EW){\textless}900, probably due to different EW distributions. Measurements on dry membranes confirm that Hyflon Ion has a higher glass transition temperature compared to Nafion, which makes it a more promising material for high temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell operation (T{\textgreater}100°C). Beginning of life fuel cell performance has also been confirmed to be higher than that given by a Nafion membrane of equal thickness.},

	abstract = {Perfluorosulfonic-acid (PFSA) membranes are widely used as the solid electrolyte in electrochemical devices where their main functionalities are ion (proton) conduction and gas separation in a thermomechanically stable matrix. Due to prolonged operational requirements in these devices, PFSA membranes’ properties change with time due to hygrothermal aging. This paper studies the evolution of PFSA structure/property relationship changes during hygrothermal aging, including chemical changes leading to changes in ion-exchange capacity (IEC), nanostructure, water-uptake behavior, conductivity, and mechanical properties. Our findings demonstrate that with hygrothermal aging, the storage modulus increases, while IEC and water content decrease, consistent with the changes in nanostructure, that is, water- and crystalline-domain spacings inferred from small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) experiments. In addition, the impact of aging is found to depend on the membrane's thermal prehistory and post-treatments, although universal correlations exist between nanostructural changes and water uptake. The findings have impact on understanding lifetime, durability, and use of these and related polymers in various technologies. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

            In recent years, considerable research and development efforts are devoted to improving the performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. However, the power density and catalytic activities of these energy conversion devices are still far from being satisfactory for large-scale operation. Here we report performance enhancement via incorporation, in the cathode catalyst layers, of a ring-structured backbone matrix into ionomers. Electrochemical characterizations of single cells and microelectrodes reveal that high power density is obtained using an ionomer with high oxygen solubility. The high solubility allows oxygen to permeate the ionomer/catalyst interface and react with protons and electrons on the catalyst surfaces. Furthermore, characterizations of single cells and single-crystal surfaces reveal that the oxygen reduction reaction activity is enhanced owing to the mitigation of catalyst poisoning by sulfonate anion groups. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that both the high permeation and poisoning mitigation are due to the suppression of densely layered folding of polymer backbones near the catalyst surfaces by the incorporated ring-structured matrix. These experimental and theoretical observations demonstrate that ionomer’s tailored molecular design promotes local oxygen transport and catalytic reactions.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were executed to clarify origins of the experimentally-observed high interfacial resistivity against the O2 permeation through the Nafion ionomer thin film coated on the Pt surface, which is known to limit the power density of polymer electrolyte fuel cells with low Pt loadings. To describe the structures and transport properties of O2 molecules inside the Nafion ionomer accurately, a new set of force field functions and parameters are proposed on the basis of the DFT calculations on molecular fragments composing the interfacial materials. MD simulations using the new parameter set reproduced well the experimentally-measured self-diffusion coefficient, solubility and permeation flux of O2 molecules in the ionomer, and detailed free energy analysis indicated the presence of two distinctive barriers limiting the O2 permeation flux at the gas/Nafion interface and Nafion/Pt interface. The former barrier dominates the O2 solubility in the ionomer, and the latter barrier dominates the interfacial permeation resistivity at the Nafion/Pt interface. The rate-determining step of the O2 permeation was judged as the interfacial permeation at the Nafion/Pt interface, and the high interfacial resistance at the Nafion/Pt interface was attributed to a dense ionomer-layer formed near the Pt surface. Suppressions of their formations were, therefore, considered to be significant for enhancing the O2 permeation through the ionomer thin film.},

	abstract = {The integration of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack into vehicles necessitates the replacement of high-priced platinum (Pt)-based electrocatalyst, which contributes to about 45\% of the cost of the stack. The implementation of high-performance and durable Pt metal-free catalyst for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) could significantly enable large-scale commercialization of fuel cell–powered vehicles. Towards this goal, a simple, scalable, single-step synthesis method was adopted to develop palladium-cobalt alloy supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (Pd3Co/NG) nanocomposite. Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) studies for the electrochemical activity towards ORR indicates that ORR proceeds via nearly four-electron mechanism. Besides, the mass activity of Pd3Co/NG shows an enhancement of 1.6 times compared to that of Pd/NG. The full fuel cell measurements were carried out using Pd3Co/NG at the anode, cathode in conjunction with Pt/C and simultaneously at both anode and cathode. A maximum power density of 68 mW/cm2 is accomplished from the simultaneous use of Pd3Co/NG as both anode and cathode electrocatalyst with individual loading of 0.5 mg/cm2 at 60 °C without any backpressure. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first of its kind of a fully non-Pt based PEM full cell.},

	abstract = {Owing to its unique electrical and structural properties, high surface area carbon has found widespread use as a catalyst support material in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) electrodes. The highly dynamic operating conditions in automotive applications require robust and durable catalyst support materials. In this chapter, carbon corrosion kinetics of commercial conventional-carbon-supported membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are presented. Carbon corrosion was investigated under various automotive fuel cell operating conditions. Fuel cell system start/stop and anode local hydrogen starvation are two major contributors to carbon corrosion. Projections from these studies indicate that conventional-carbon-supported MEAs fall short of meeting automotive the durability targets of PEMFCs. MEAs made of different carbon support materials were evaluated for their resistance to carbon corrosion under accelerated test conditions. The results show that graphitized-carbon-supported MEAs are more resistant to carbon corrosion than nongraphitized carbon materials. Fundamental model analyses incorporating the measured carbon corrosion kinetics were developed for start/stop and local hydrogen starvation conditions. The combination of experiment and modeling suggests that MEAs with corrosion-resistant carbon supports are promising material approaches to mitigate carbon corrosion during automotive fuel cell operation.},

Particularly, the microstructure of high surface area carbon (HSC) support upon which both the platinum catalyst and ionomer are dispersed play a pivotal role in controlling the reactant transport to the active site in the catalyst layer. In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the underlying microstructure of platinum-cobalt catalyst dispersed on various HSC supports in terms of their surface area and pore-size distribution. The carbon microstructure was found to strongly influence the PtCo nanoparticle dispersion, catalyst layer ionomer distribution and transport losses governing the performance at HCD. Catalyst layer electrochemical diagnostics carried out to quantify local-O2 transport resistance and bulk-H+ transport resistance in the cathode were found to be directly correlated to the micropore ({\textless}2 nm) and macropore ({\textgreater}8 nm) surface areas of the carbon support, respectively. Finally, a 1D-performance model has been developed to assimilate our understanding of the catalyst layer microstructure and transport resistances at HCD.},

Our results from integrating a pre-commercial HOPI with robust, state-of-the-art catalysts with medium and low surface area carbon supports show significant increases in specific activities (67\% increase over the standard commercial ionomer) at low current densities and reduced oxygen (O2) transport resistances (RO2’s) at high current densities, enabling both higher efficiency and peak power density. The reduction in the RO2 with the HOPI is most significant at low relative humidity (RH), due to its more rigid backbone structure resisting compaction at lower water contents. In our ink optimization analysis, we show that the HOPI in this study achieves its peak performance with an ionomer to carbon ratio (I/C) of 0.6 and a moderately alcohol-rich ink solvent when fabricating catalyst layers by the decal method with an automatic wet film coater.},

In this work, we report the water content and proton conductivity properties of thin-film ionomers (30 nm) at 80 °C over a wide range of relative humidity (0–90\%) for seven different ionomers differing in the side-chain structure, including the number of protogenic groups, with the equivalent weight ranging from 620 to 1100 g/mol of sulfonic acid. The results show that the acid content or equivalent weight of the ionomer is the strongest determinant of both the swelling and the proton conductivity of ionomer films at a given relative humidity. The molar water content (λ) of ionomer films normalized to the molar protogenic group is observed to be equivalent-weight-dependent, implying that the affinity for water is acid-content-dependent. At high relative humidity conditions ({\textgreater}70\%) pertinent to fuel cell operations, the proton conductivity of low-equivalent-weight ionomers was higher than that of higher-equivalent-weight ionomers. However, upon correlating the proton conductivity with molar water content (λ), the differences reduce dramatically, highlighting that water content is the controlling factor for proton conduction. Significantly higher values of both water content and proton conductivity are observed at 80 °C compared to those at 30 °C, implying that room temperature data are not reliable for estimating ionomer properties in the fuel cell catalyst layer.},

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction results showed evidence of both non-crystalline and crystalline ordered hydrophobic regions in all the EW membranes except the 700 EW membrane. The spectral changes evident in the vibrational spectra of the 3M membranes can be associated with two major phenomena: (1) dissociation of the proton from the sulfonic acid groups even in the presence of small amounts of water; and (2) changes in the conformation or the degree of crystallinity of the poly(tetrafluoroethylene) hydrophobic domains both as a function of EW and membrane water content. All the membranes, regardless of EW, are thermally stable up to 360 °C. The wet membranes have conductivities between 7 and 20 mS/cm at 125 °C. In this condition, the conductivity values follow VTF behavior, which suggests that the proton migration occurs via proton exchange processes between delocalization bodies (DBs) that are facilitated by the dynamics of the host polymer. The conductivity along the interface between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains makes a larger contribution in the smaller EW membranes likely due to the existence of a greater number of interfaces in the membrane. The larger crystalline domains present in the higher EW membranes provide percolation pathways for charge migration between DBs, which reduces the probability of charge transfer along the interface. Therefore, at higher EWs although there is charge migration along the interface within the hydrophobic–hydrophilic domains, the exchange of protons between different DBs is likely the rate-limiting step of the overall conduction process.},

An interfacial oxygen transport resistance and inner resistivity of the Nafion thin film were separately determined by the relation between jd−1 normalized by oxygen partial pressure and the film thickness. The interfacial resistance is equivalent to 30–70nm of the Nafion film, which are much thicker than a typical ionomer thickness of ∼10nm observed in catalyst layers. From the above results and our recent theoretical results obtained by molecular dynamics techniques, the oxygen permeation fluxes through the ionomers in catalyst layers can be regarded as dominantly controlled by the oxygen permeation at the Pt/ionomer interface.},

Commercially available ionomers are based on a perfluorinated chemistry comprised of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) matrix that imparts low gas permeability and high mechanical strength but introduces significant mass-transport losses in the electrodes. These transport losses currently limit PEFC performance, especially for low Pt loadings. In this study, we present a novel ionomer incorporating a glassy amorphous matrix based on a perfluoro(2-methylene-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolane) (PFMMD) backbone. The novel backbone chemistry induces structural changes in the ionomer, restricting ionomer domain swelling under hydration while disrupting matrix crystallinity. These structural changes slightly reduce proton conductivity while significantly improving gas permeability. The performance implications of this trade-off are assessed, which reveal the potential for substantial performance improvement by incorporation of highly permeable ionomers as the functional catalyst binder. These results underscore the significance of tailoring material chemistry to specific device requirements, where ionomer chemistry should be rationally designed to match the local transport requirements of the device architecture.},

Through these simulations, the structural and transport properties of the three-phase system are investigated. The molecular interactions among the components of the three-phase interfacial system are examined by density functional theory and parameterized for potential energy functions of force field. First, we investigate the interactions of the Pt clusters with various molecules as a function of distance using the density functional theory method with dispersion correction. Based on the results of these calculations, a non-bonded interaction curve is built for each Pt–molecule pair. Such non-bonded interaction curves are reproduced by potential energy functions with optimized parameters. Based on these investigations, we develop a force field to describe the structures and transport properties of the Nafion–Pt–carbon (graphite) three-phase interfacial system using molecular dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.
Program Summary
Program Title: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cxbxs9btsv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/lammps/lammps Licensing provisions: GPLv2 Programming language: C++, Python, C, Fortran Supplementary material: https://www.lammps.org Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the LAMMPS code.

Over the past several decades they have been the focus of considerable research and development for their use as the electrolyte in energy conversion and storage devices. Recent and significant results obtained from multiscale simulations and modeling for proton exchange membranes (PEMs), anion exchange membranes (AEMs), and polymerized ionic liquids (polyILs) are reviewed. The interplay of morphology and ion transport is emphasized. We discuss the influences of polymer architecture, tethered ionic groups, rigidity of the backbone, solvents, and additives on both morphology and ion transport in terms of specific interactions. Novel design strategies are highlighted including precisely controlling molecular conformations to design highly ordered morphologies; tuning the solvation structure of hydronium or hydroxide ions in hydrated ion exchange membranes; turning negative ion-ion correlations to positive correlations to improve ionic conductivity in polyILs; and balancing the strength of noncovalent interactions. The design of single-ion conductors, well-defined supramolecular architectures with enhanced one-dimensional ion transport, and the understanding of the hierarchy of the specific interactions continue as challenges but promising goals for future research.},

This work focuses on a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) scale analysis of cathode catalyst layer (CCL) degradation processes occurring during catalyst accelerated stability testing (AST). We examined the degradation of the carbon support, decrease in electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and formation of a platinum (Pt) band. We utilized a combined electrochemical and ex-situ nanoscale X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) imaging technique to characterize these important degradation processes in state-of-the-art MEAs and examined the effects of AST cycling on two carbon supports, Vulcan (Vu) and a KetjenBlack high surface area carbon (HSC), and two Pt-based catalysts, pure Pt and PtCo. We found that neither support nor catalyst type completely suppressed the formation of a Pt band, but we did find that the PtCo catalyst and HSC support combination was able to limit the ECSA loss and Pt band formation better than the pure Pt and Vu combination. Our results also showed some loss of macroporosity in the HSC support after catalyst AST cycling, helping to explain the reduced performance seen with HSC-supported catalysts at high current densities.},

Pt catalyst degradation mechanisms with the typically observed Pt nanoparticle growth behaviors have not been completely understood and predicted. In this work, a physics-based Pt/C catalyst degradation model is proposed with a simplified bi-modal particle size distribution. The following catalyst degradation processes were considered: (1) dissolution of Pt and subsequent electrochemical deposition on Pt nanoparticles in cathode; (2) diffusion of Pt ions in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA); and (3) Pt ion chemical reduction in membrane by hydrogen permeating through the membrane from the negative electrode. Catalyst coarsening with Pt nanoparticle growth was clearly demonstrated by Pt mass exchange between small and large particles through Pt dissolution and Pt ion deposition. However, the model is not adequate to predict well the catalyst degradation rates including Pt nanoparticle growth, catalyst surface area loss and cathode Pt mass loss. Additional catalyst degradation processes such as new Pt cluster formation on carbon support and neighboring Pt clusters coarsening was proposed for further simulative investigation.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium concentrations of dissolved platinum species from a Pt/C electrocatalyst sample in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 80°C were found to increase with applied potential from 0.9 to 1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. In addition, platinum surface area loss for a short-stack of proton exchange membrane fuel cells PEMFCs operated at open-circuit voltage 0.95 V was shown to be higher than another operated under load 0.75 V. Both findings suggest that the formation of soluble platinum species such as Pt 2+ plays an important role in platinum surface loss in PEMFC electrodes. As accelerated platinum surface area loss in the cathode from 63 to 23 m 2 /gPt in 100 h was observed upon potential cycling, a cycled membrane electrode assembly MEA cathode was examined in detail by incidence angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy TEM to reveal processes responsible for observed platinum loss. In this study, TEM data and analyses of Pt/C catalyst and cross-sectional MEA cathode samples unambiguously confirmed that coarsening of platinum particles occurred via two different processes: i Ostwald ripening on carbon at the nanometer scale, which is responsible for platinum particle coarsening from 3t o6 nm on carbon, and ii migration of soluble platinum species in the ionomer phase at the micrometer scale, chemical reduction of these species by crossover H2 molecules, and precipitation of platinum particles in the cathode ionomer phase, which reduces the weight of platinum on carbon. It was estimated that each process contributed to 50\% of the overall platinum area loss of the potential cycled electrode.},

In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the side chain length and equivalent weight (EW) of PFSA ionomers on the CCL transport resistances. Ex situ measurements were carried out to quantify the ionomer characteristics such as the molecular weight, proton conductivity and water uptake. Nanomorphology of ionomers cast as 60–120 nm thin-films is characterized using grazing-incidence X-ray scattering. In situ fuel cell electrochemical diagnostic measurements were carried out to quantify the reactant (H+/O2) transport properties of the CCL. Ionomer EW was found to play a major role with decreasing EW yielding higher proton conductivity and water uptake that led to lower bulk-H+ and local-O2 transport resistances in the CCL. Finally, a 1D-semi-empirical performance model has been developed to quantify the impact of ionomer EW on cell voltage loss factors.},

Analyses with low-molecular-weight model anions with and without an ether group in the perfluoro-alkyl chain indicate that the anions are adsorbed on Pt through one or two oxygen atom(s) of the terminal sulfonate group and that the oxygen atom of the ether group also interacts with the Pt surface, leading to stronger adsorption of the anions with an ether group. On the basis of the results obtained with the model anions, the adsorption of the terminal sulfonate moieties in perfluorinated sulfonic acid ionomers and its effect on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is discussed.

The models are constructed by mimicking the actual shapes of Pt particles and carbon aggregates, as well as the ionomer adhesion in real CLs. CLs with different compositions are characterized by structural properties such as Pt inter-particle distance, ionomer coating thickness, pore size distribution, tortuosity, and ionomer coverage on Pt. The results for Pt/C = 1.0, i/C = 1.0 with Pt loading of 0.3 mg cm−2 and 50\% porosity are validated against measured data for CLs with the same composition. With increasing i/C ratio, the smaller pores disappear and the number of isolated pores increases; while the ionomer connection and its coverage on Pt are significantly enhanced at i/C ∼1.0. With increasing Pt/C ratio, the Pt inter-particle distance decreases as the particles connect with each other. The tortuosity of the pores and the ionomer exhibits a trade-off relation depending on the ionomer volume. Further CL design concepts to optimize both O2 diffusion and H+ conduction are discussed.},

	abstract = {Increasing catalytic activity and durability of atomically dispersed metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathode in proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells remains a grand challenge. Here, a high-power and durable Co–N–C nanofiber catalyst synthesized through electrospinning cobalt-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks into selected polyacrylonitrile and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymers is reported. The distinct porous fibrous morphology and hierarchical structures play a vital role in boosting electrode performance by exposing more accessible active sites, providing facile electron conductivity, and facilitating the mass transport of reactant. The enhanced intrinsic activity is attributed to the extra graphitic N dopants surrounding the CoN4 moieties. The highly graphitized carbon matrix in the catalyst is beneficial for enhancing the carbon corrosion resistance, thereby promoting catalyst stability. The unique nanoscale X-ray computed tomography verifies the well-distributed ionomer coverage throughout the fibrous carbon network in the catalyst. The membrane electrode assembly achieves a power density of 0.40 W cm−2 in a practical H2/air cell (1.0 bar) and demonstrates significantly enhanced durability under accelerated stability tests. The combination of the intrinsic activity and stability of single Co sites, along with unique catalyst architecture, provide new insight into designing efficient PGM-free electrodes with improved performance and durability.},

The polymer has an extremely high fractional free volume of 0.327. Permeability coefficients for helium, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, and chlorodifluoromethane (Freon 22) were determined at temperatures from 25 to 60°C and pressures from 20 to 120 psig. Permeation properties were also determined at a feed pressure of 200 psig at 25°C with a 2 mol\% n-butane/98 mol\% methane mixture. Permeabilities of permanent gases in Teflon AF 2400 are among the highest of all known polymers; the oxygen permeability coefficient at 25°C is 1600 × 10−10 cm3 (STP) cm/cm2 s cmHg and the nitrogen permeability coefficient is 780 × 10−10 cm3 (STP) cm/cm2 s cmHg. The permeabilities of organic vapors increase up to 20-fold as the vapor activity increases from 0.1 to unity, indicating that Teflon AF 2400 is easily plasticized. Although Teflon AF 2400 is an ultrahigh-free-volume polymer like poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) [PTMSP], their gas permeation properties differ significantly. Teflon AF 2400 shows gas transport behavior similar to that of conventional, low-free-volume glassy polymers.

Despite the existence of relevant demonstrations and few commercial fleets, there are still a series of issues such as the durability of the materials and the cost of platinum which limit a wider application in this field. To this regard, better utilization and consequently loading reduction of Pt in electrodes is of outstanding importance. Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and application of an ionomer in the cathode catalyst layer; thanks to its higher oxygen permeability the quantity of Pt may be minimized. This ionomer is a modification of commercial Aquivion® PFSA obtained by incorporation of a third monomer (2,2,4-trifluoro-5trifluoromethoxy-1,3-dioxole, MDO). Results on cast membrane demonstrate a 20\% higher oxygen permeability of the new ionomer compared to Aquivion PFSA E87-05S and Nafion NR212 at 100\% RH. Furthermore, an improvement of the performance of a PEM-FC in automotive conditions (RH=40-70\%) is obtained with the assembly where this ionomer is used as cathode binder. In particular polarization curve at 70\% RH shows improvement of 20\% of power density peak and electrochemical impedance confirms higher oxygen permeability due to lower mass transport resistance than Aquivion.},

	abstract = {We report results of quantum mechanics (QM) mechanistic studies of Nafion membrane degradation in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Experiments suggest that Nafion degradation is caused by generation of trace radical species (such as OH●, H●) only when in the presence of H2, O2, and Pt. We use density functional theory (DFT) to construct the potential energy surfaces for various plausible reactions involving intermediates that might be formed when Nafion is exposed to H2 (or H+) and O2 in the presence of the Pt catalyst. We find a barrier of 0.53 eV for OH radical formation from HOOH chemisorbed on Pt(111) and of 0.76 eV from chemisorbed OOHad, suggesting that OH might be present during the ORR, particularly when the fuel cell is turned on and off. Based on the QM, we propose two chemical mechanisms for OH radical attack on the Nafion polymer: (1) OH attack on the S–C bond to form H2SO4 plus a carbon radical (barrier: 0.96 eV) followed by decomposition of the carbon radical to form an epoxide (barrier: 1.40 eV). (2) OH attack on H2 crossover gas to form hydrogen radical (barrier: 0.04 eV), which subsequently attacks a C–F bond to form HF plus carbon radicals (barrier as low as 1.00 eV). This carbon radical can then decompose to form a ketone plus a carbon radical with a barrier of 0.86 eV. The products (HF, OCF2, SCF2) of these proposed mechanisms have all been observed by F NMR in the fuel cell exit gases along with the decrease in pH expected from our mechanism.},

	abstract = {Neutron reflectometry was used to examine the interactions of polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) materials that comprise the triple-phase interface. Smooth, idealized layers of Nafion on glassy carbon (GC) and Pt surfaces were used to experimentally model the PEFC electrode interfaces. Different multilayer structures of Nafion were found in contact with the Pt or GC surfaces. These structures showed separate hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains formed within the Nafion layer when equilibrated with saturated D2O vapor. A hydrophobic Nafion region was formed adjacent to a Pt film. However, when Nafion was in contact with a PtO surface, the Nafion at the Pt interface became hydrophilic. The adsorbed oxide layer caused a long-range restructuring of the perfluorosulfonic acid polymer chains that comprise Nafion. The thicknesses of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains changed to the same magnitude when the oxide layer was present compared to a thin hydrophobic domain in contact with Pt. A three-layer Nafion structure was formed when Nafion was in direct contact with GC. The findings in this research are direct experimental evidence that both the interfacial and long-range structural properties of Nafion are affected by the material with which it is in contact. Evidence of physical changes of aged Nafion films was obtained, and the results showed a permanent increase in the thickness of the Nafion film and a decrease in the scattering length density (SLD), which are attributed to irreversible swelling of the Nafion film. The aging also resulted in a decrease in the SLD of the GC substrate, which is likely due to either an increase in surface oxidation of the carbon or loss of carbon mass at the GC surface.},

The system performance and stability are related to the transport and mechanical properties of the ionomers, which are correlated through physiochemical interactions and morphology. Thus, there exists a balance between the chemical and mechanical energies which controls the structure–function relationship of the ionomer. In this paper, it is reported how and why thermal treatments result in different water uptakes and nanostructures for a perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane. The nanostructure of the PFSA membrane is characterized using small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments. These changes are correlated with water content and mechanical properties and result in fundamental relationships to characterize the membrane with different thermal histories. Moreover, quasi-equilibrium water uptake and domain spacing both decrease with predrying or preconstraining the membrane, thereby suggesting that similar mechanical energies govern the structural changes via internal and external constraints, respectively. The findings suggest that heat treatments alter the balance between the chemical–mechanical energies where the interplay of the morphology and mechanical properties controls the structure–function relationship of the membrane. Finally, a model is developed using an energy-balance approach with inputs of the mechanical and structural properties; the dependence of water uptake on pretreatment is successfully predicted.},

Here, we report on perfuoro ionene chain extended (PFICE) ionomers that contain either one or two bis(sulfonyl)imide groups on the side-chain in addition to a terminal sulfonic acid group. PFICE ionomers exhibit greater water uptake and conductivity compared to prototypical perfluorinated sulfonic acid ionomers. Advanced in situ synchrotron characterization reveals insights into the connections between molecular structure and morphology that dictate performance. Guided by first-principles calculations, X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the sulfur K-edge can discern distinct protogenic groups and be sensitive to hydration level and configurations that dictate proton dissociation. In situ resonant X-ray scattering at the sulfur K-edge reveals that PFICE ionomers have a phase-separated morphology with enhanced short-range order that persists in both dry and hydrated states. The enhanced conductivity of PFICE ionomers is attributed to a unique multi-acid side-chain chemistry and structure that facilitates proton dissociation at low water content in combination with a well-ordered phase-separated morphology with nanoscale transport pathways. Overall, these results provide insights for the design of new ionomers with tunable phase separation and improved transport properties as well as demonstrating the efficacy of X-rays with elemental sensitivity for unraveling structural features in chemically heterogeneous functional materials for electrochemical energy applications.},

	abstract = {Perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomers are the most widely used solid electrolyte in electrochemical technologies due to their remarkable ionic conductivity with simultanous mechanical stability, imparted by their phase-separated morphology. In this work, the morphology and swelling of PFSA ionomers (Nafion and 3M) as bulk membranes ({\textgreater}10 μm) and dispersion-cast thin films ({\textless}100 nm) are investigated to identify the roles of equivalent weight (EW) and side-chain length across lengthscales. Humidity-dependent structural changes as well as different PFSA chemistries are explored in the thin-film regime, allowing for the development of thickness-EW phase diagrams. The ratio of macroscopic (thickness) to nanoscopic (domain spacing) swelling during hydration is found to be affine (1:1) in thin films, but increases as the thickness approaches bulk values, revealing the existence of a mesoscale organization governing the multiscale swelling in PFSAs. Ionomer chemistry, in particular EW, is found to play a key role in altering the confinement-driven structural changes, including thin-film anisotropy, with phase separation becoming weaker as the film thickness is reduced below 25 nm or as EW is increased. For the lower-EW 3M PFSA ionomers, confinement appears to induce even stronger phase separation accompanied by domain alignment parallel to the substrate.},

	abstract = {Ionomers are important to electrode function in energy conversion devices, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, as the catalyst-binding nanometer-thick films under confinement, which compromises mass transport of species. Mitigating confinement effects is necessary for improved performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Studies on perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomers provided insights into origins of transport resistances, but limited improvements by current strategies necessitate a need for alternative chemistries to enhance film function. This work investigates new ionomers based on sidechain modifications of PFSA to tune local acidity and structure. Their application-relevant properties (hydration, thermal-transition) and nanomorphology are systematically characterized using environmental ellipsometry and grazing-incidence X-ray scattering, respectively, to develop chemistry-structure-property relationships in thin-film motif (≤100 nm). Introducing acid sites to sidechains improves hydration and nano-phase-separation but reduce chain mobility. Replacing the hydrophilic end-groups with hydrophobic perfluoro-groups enhances mobility but disrupts phase-separation. Although modifying sidechain functional groups alters ionomer-substrate interactions (Pt/C), chemistry has greater influence on structure-properties. Proton conductivity correlates with hydration, regardless of chemistry. This work improves the fundamental understanding of chemistry-function relationships of ionomers by providing a novel means to independently control their side-chain vs. end-group and observe resulting effects on interfacial properties to modulate electrode function in electrochemical technologies.},

	abstract = {Ionomer thin-films (i.e., 20–100 nm) on supports serve as model systems to understand ionomer-catalyst interfacial behavior as well as the confinement-driven deviation in properties from bulk membranes. While ionomer thin-films have been examined for proton exchange ionomers, the thin-film properties of anion exchange ionomers (AEIs) remain largely unexplored. More importantly, delineating the convoluted impact of chemistry and confinement on thin-film morphology and hydration is of interest to advancing the field on functional ionic interfaces. In this work, these aspects are studied by using AEIs of different backbones (perfluorinated, aliphatic, and aromatic) and side chains (various lengths, and single versus dual functional groups). Quartz-crystal microbalance and spectroscopic ellipsometry are used to analyze density and coupled with calculated free volume fraction of thin-films to provide insights on their gas transport properties. AEI side-chain's chemical character plays a key role in how confinement modulates hydration (in thin-film versus bulk). The results elucidate the effects of backbone, side-chain chemistry versus anion/cation type in the confinement-driven changes in thin-film morphology and swelling. This study also provides new insights for tuning AEI transport functionalities at interfaces via chemistry, which can benefit the design and development of electrode-ionomers for alkaline membrane-based energy systems.},

	abstract = {Transport phenomena are key in controlling the performance of electrochemical energy-conversion technologies and can be highly complex, involving multiple length scales and materials/phases. Material designs optimized for one reactant species transport however may inhibit other transport processes. We explore such trade-offs in the context of polymer-electrolyte fuel-cell electrodes, where ionomer thin films provide the necessary proton conductivity but retard oxygen transport to the Pt reaction site and cause interfacial resistance due to sulfonate/Pt interactions. We examine the electrode overall gas-transport resistance and its components as a function of ionomer content and chemistry. Low-equivalent-weight ionomers allow better dissolved-gas and proton transport due to greater water uptake and low crystallinity but also cause significant interfacial resistance due to the high density of sulfonic acid groups. These effects of equivalent weight are also observed via in situ ionic conductivity and CO displacement measurements. Of critical importance, the results are supported by ex situ ellipsometry and X-ray scattering of model thin-film systems, thereby providing direct linkages and applicability of model studies to probe complex heterogeneous structures. Structural and resultant performance changes in the electrode are shown to occur above a threshold sulfonic-group loading, highlighting the significance of ink-based interactions. Our findings and methodologies are applicable to a variety of solid-state energy-conversion devices and material designs.},

AF1600 results were compared to those of another copolymer, AF2400, which contains 87 mol % BDD. As the amount of bulky, packing-disrupting BDD increases, solubility coefficients increase systematically, primarily due to increases in the nonequilibrium excess volume of the glassy polymer. Permeability and diffusivity also increase with increasing BDD content. AF1600 is easily plasticized by larger, more soluble penetrants and is susceptible to penetrant-induced conditioning. As penetrant size increases, permeability and diffusion coefficients decrease. The rates of decrease of permeability and diffusivity with increasing penetrant size, which characterize permeability and diffusivity selectivity, are intermediate between those of conventional glassy polymers and exceptionally high free volume glassy materials such as poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) (PTMSP). Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) results suggest unusually large free volume elements and a bimodal distribution of free volume element size:  this is consistent with similar results obtained earlier for other high free volume glassy polymers such as AF2400 and PTMSP. Inverse gas chromatography and PALS estimates of free volume element size distributions were consistent.}, number={25}, journal={Macromolecules}, publisher={American Chemical Society}, author={Alentiev, A.

Sorption isotherms of all penetrants except hydrogen are concave to the pressure axis and are well-described by the dual-mode model. Hydrogen exhibits linear sorption isotherms. In contrast to previous results in hydrocarbon-rich polymers, the solubility of perfluorocarbon penetrants is higher in TFE/BDD87 than that of their hydrocarbon analogues. The solubility of all penetrants in TFE/BDD87 decreases with increasing temperature. Enthalpies of sorption become more negative as penetrant size increases. Fluorocarbon enthalpies of sorption at infinite dilution are significantly more exothermic than those of their hydrocarbon analogues, suggesting more favorable interactions between fluorocarbon penetrants and perfluorinated TFE/BDD87 than between hydrocarbon penetrants and this polymer. Perfluorocarbon permeability coefficients are nearly an order of magnitude lower than those of their hydrocarbon analogues due to the larger size of the fluorocarbons and their subsequently lower diffusivities. The permeability of TFE/BDD87 increases with increasing temperature, indicating that activation energies of permeation (Ep) are positive. Ep values in TFE/BDD87 are smaller than those of conventional glassy polymers. Diffusion coefficients of the lower sorbing gases (O2, N2, CO2, CH4, CF4) exhibit a concentration dependence that is consistent with dual-mode transport in unplasticized glassy polymers. For more strongly sorbing C2H6, C3H8, C2F6, and C3F8, diffusion coefficients increase exponentially with increasing penetrant concentration, suggesting plasticization. Activation energies of diffusion in TFE/BDD87 are positive and increase linearly with penetrant diameter squared. Relative to conventional glassy polymers, ED values in TFE/BDD87 are low. However, |ED| is larger than |ΔHS|. TFE/BDD87 is easily plasticized by the larger, more soluble penetrants and is susceptible to penetrant-induced conditioning. The level of conditioning is highest for the largest, most soluble penetrant examined (C3F8), and the conditioned state gradually relaxes toward that of the as-cast state.}, number={25}, journal={Macromolecules}, publisher={American Chemical Society}, author={Merkel, T.
